Story of the Lost Legacy: 
 
ACT I: The crash.

After hundreds of years spent in cryogenic hibernation, the imperial colonization 
fleet of humatran had finally arrived at destination: The first system of the edge 
of the closest galaxy. The life systems were reactivated in each starship and vessel 
and all the crews began with being awoken when the external warning systems are activated.
The star of the system that they had chosen as destination was in its final phase of life, 
and well before what they had provided before their departure. 
At once the emergency plan of launched repatriation. But too late, the bad luck was 
still on them, the star began its explosion... 

A ray of a sharp red put to shine in all space around them. Panic seized each one and 
each spaceship started to operate in order to be the first to set out again. The small vessels, 
lighter and more handy, were already in the axis of return and had begun to accelerate, 
while largest like, the flagships hardly came to start his turn. When the first wave of 
the explosion reached the fleet, the lightest vessels were at once to sweep like simple sheets 
with the wind, while the majority of largest started with disintagrate slowly. Luckiest 
of these had begun the phase of acceleration by choosing other axes of folds, 
when the second and last blast reached the fleet... 

The fleet was almost destroyed by this second deadly blast, the vessels which survived there 
were only one handle and the state of each one of them be pitiful. Only one could still 
make fully function its engines and immediately undertook operations of accostings to 
rescue the crew of the other mostly destroyed ships. But the return in their galaxy was 
impossible, all auto-navigation systems were out of oder like all the communication systems. 
Their only hope, quite mean, was to find a planet to be able to settle there as they would 
have to do it but under other conditions. 

They spent the whole months in space in the search of a planet to enable them to live, 
when finally they approached the first whose characteristics was not completely hostile. 
In any event they did not have the choice because the food were insufficient to continue 
and the life on board man-of-war was uncomfortable and became insuportable. When the vessel 
entering the atmosphere began its landing operation, the undergone damages were much more 
serious than envisaged. The control sytems in atmosphere burnt the ones after the others 
and the crash of the vessel was sure... The crew did run in all rescue pods. The vessel 
released plenty thus small pods which moved towards the surface of planet with softness 
while it continued its infernal descent. 

ACT II: Birth of a giant. 

The first members of crew whose landed pods had already begun their new life on this planet 
of the hundreds of survivors gathered for origaniser the localization and the search for 
their vessel. When they arrived on the place of the crash, there remained only burning sheets 
on the ground. It remain to them nothing!!! No more space transports, neither 
communication systems, nor tools. They were all to rebuild, all to rediscover, all relearn... 
But life taken again well quickly... 

A few hundred years later, the following generations which had colonized the planet, 
rebuilt all the technology of which old theirs had transmitted the knowledge and the plans 
to through the few holodisk ones. They relearned to travel trough space and leave to conquer 
the galaxy. They meet other civilizations, of which some had common ancestors, "travellers 
of stars" as called them by still primitive tribes which were descandant of other vessels 
which had not been able to join their galaxy of origin... 

The hostile meetings also multiplied and the wars were not rare. The pacts of peace, 
the treaties of alliance or civilizations extraterrestrial which were integrated into 
their, contributed to reinforce their force, their capacity, their knowledge and their 
technology. Their power and them influance on the galaxy, made only grow. When the moment 
had come they think to find their lost Legacy, their civilization of origin of which 
they had been cut for a long time... 

Not having any report/ratio coming from the probes which they had sent 
they envoy a large fleet of reconquer. This new fleet of return to their galaxy of origin 
began to start through space and travelled during years... But what they found while 
arriving in this galaxy was very far from being as what reported the old men holidisks... 
The planets were devastated by wars whose forces could be only of galactic size. 
The surface of each planet which they visited were completely destroyed. 
no more resources, nor trace of life, only of the traces of violent wars and dead civilizations. 
no more sign of their civilization mother. The first meeting with the forces armed with 
the two camps in war was far from being peaceful because each one saw in them a potential danger, 
a trick of the enemy, and thus was to thus treat them as enemies. 

These quarrelsome forces bore the name of the CORE and the ARM...

XTA 9.739 Svn 674
|jls		

Fix slow brakerate of transports
Increased tolerance and max fire angle (52 -> 64 degrees, or 26 -> 32 per side) of core rapier to help it overcome targetting issues
  on steep slopes, which arm brawler didn't have in spite of similar values of those parameters.
Reduce arm zeus hp 4200 -> 3800
arm/core torpedo launcher: double damage and increase reloadtime from 3.0 to 5.0.
Increase t2 sub's damage against other subs by 20 %, because otherwise t1 sub would deal more dps per build cost

Fix team commander ends fault in games with more than 2 teams
Remove countdown text before replay starts

|jls	
	
Core Pillager is now transportable by air
Added mod option to allow transportation of hovercrafts (key: mo_transporthover 0|1).

Fixed cannon velocity parameter messing with Arm Tornado
Changed mines and critters to not show on sonar
Added option to show modoptions in-game by pressing ctrl-i (needs <<XTA Settings GUI>> widget enabled)
Added player start positions to show on <<MiniMap Start Boxes>> widget

XTA 9.737 Svn 652
|jls	

Fixed (again, hopefully) the bug that prevents end window to show up. It's however a difficult bug to reproduce, so it's hard to 
  know exactly what to fix. Reduced the time the victory/defeat text is shown from 4 to 2 secs.
Fixed bug with Pelican not changing movement type when transforming to hover/reforming to kbot
Made area guard widget only select mobile units when using advanced modes (adv. modes are: alt: distribute squads, ctrl: persistent squads)
Added Enemy spotter widget by floris (is another teamplatter widget)
Fixed cob-error about missing functions for some aircraft.
Fixed mex-upgrader to again work with area command. It reverses one lua-error fix, but it's a rare one and it's better than area command works
Now there are no more bugs in xta: please report more bugs to http://code.google.com/p/xta-springrts/issues/list
Reduce non-gunship aircraft brakerate to 10% like it was before engine removed the scale factor. However, it doesn't seem to fix stopping bombers

|jls	

Fixed (hopefully) all bugs relating to end statistics and the internal procedure relating to it. Added two small buttons in 
  top right corner that let's you toggle between both graphs
Airplanes now have less LOS and less AirLOS when they are landed. Now you can't land a peeper in a remote corner and gain LOS of
  it until enemy discovers it.
Fixed bug where landed fighters keep shooting at enemy stuff
Increased turnrate of torpedoes from seaplanes so that they won't miss ships if dropped too close to them (15000 -> 25000)
Added visual effects that help you see when a seaplane has submerged under water and risen above it again
Fixed some ships shooting at aircraft (missile frigates, warlord, etc)
Fixed bug where only arm construction seaplane could submerge and not core: now they both can
Enable depthmod for some kbots and tanks, means that units move slower the deeper the water is: 
  Fido, maverick, can: max.slowdown in water = 33% 
  gimp, spiders: 50% 
  commanders: 45%
  beaver, crab, triton, crock, garpike, muskrat: 50%
  crawling bombs: 33%
Widgets: mex upgrader error fixed, added options to tweak-gui widget: fullscreen option (requires spring 97), option to turn off
  move-failed notifications when builder can't reach target), made select and center widget faster to zoom.

Decreased cloaktimeout for automatic commanders: arm: 4.2 s -> 2.8, core: 4.2 s -> 3.0. The commander is visible somewhat longer 
  than this time due to the silhouette effect. Also decreased for level 2 manual commanders: 4.2-> 3.4/3.6; L3 and L4 have 
  same values as automatic commanders.
Increased area of effect of rocko/storm: 48 -> 65. This will deal a little damage to walled mexxes/llt:s

 * cure for zombie virus

XTA 9.73 Svn 545
|dnw, jls, klt,nor,kno

* New things:
  Updated Xtaids, added new unitpack that functions, called spiders vs. tortoise. Both work need more balance tests. Noruas
  Added area guard gadget and widget combo. Works like area attack but for guard command. Enable/disable by toggling the Area 
	Guard widget in F11 menu. Widget listens to keyboard shortcut "g". The widget has three modes:
	1) Basic mode: drag over units to guard, all selected units will guard all units.
	2) Distributive mode (hold alt and drag): distribute the guard task into squadrons based on how many units you have selected
	  to guard.
	3) Persistent mode (hold alt+ctrl and drag): makes the squadrons permanent. When one unit in the squadron gets damaged, the 
	  unit guarding the squadron will shift the guard task to prioritise the unit wth least health. Selecting a unit that is 
	  guarding a squadron and pressing "stop" will also clear the guard task.
  New spectator mode in commander change widget
  Added buttons for selecting game speed when watching replays
  Zombie mode
  New mouse cursors: select, airstrike, bad load, bad unload, upgrade metal extractor
  New bloomshader widget
  Updated pause screen. It has music that can be disabled/enabled with commands /musicoff and /musicon or /disablemusic and /enablemusic

  New commander songs
  Team-died messages make their comeback: suggest new ones in forum
  Smarter logic for unit under attack warning sounds
  
* Changes:
  Increased cost of Guardian and Punisher shots to double, from 250 to 500 per shot, roughly twice as much and a bit more than 
	a pop up cannon at 230 Energy.
  Reduced cost of stealthing for Cloakable fusion reactors and spy kbots by 50E
  Aircraft plants include runways for hit detection and selection
  Increase metal costs of Freedom Fighter, Avenger, Thunder and Shadow by about 10 %, increase energy cost and build time too.
    Decrease HP of same units by 10 % and more for scout planes. Decrease fire angle of T1 fighters 100 => 70 and T2 fighters 110 => 90
  In game with commander ends: winner will not be last commander alive if he dguns enemy commander

* Bugfixes: 
  Added missing minelayer-limit icons, fixed bug for xtaids hovercraft minelayers. jls
  Mine layer gadget fixed for XTAids units and other bugs Noruas
  Fixed a bug with moho metal maker's missing explosions: they were set to "", now they use same explosions as in BA
  Fixed minelayer mine-limit exploit. Now it won't finish the mine if it's not in stock.
  Fixed double projectile for CORE Garpike and ARM Crab, making them quite OP for their price
  Fixed Dynamic Collision Volume gadget not scaling 3DO model radius and height if used for a unit with a dynamic CV
  Fixed many oversized collision volumes, happened due to changes in 94.1 engine

    Symbolical: BuildBar, Waypoint Dragger, Selection Buttons
  Improve performance of Dynamic Lighting when used together with Local Sounds, otherwise no performance change
  Updated CustomFormations to show end points for unit destinations, some other small fixes
  Halved the number of flame projectiles per second for Pyros and Levelers, damage and visuals adjusted to look and feel as before

* SVN:
  Rename all files that had upper-case letters to lower-case (fixes possible linux vs windows issues)


XTA v9.729
|dnw, jls,nor,kno

* Added animals that wander around the map:
  critters are invisible on minimap+radar and have a blank icon, as not to be confused with player units
  enjoy the amazing duck and friends!
  i tried to not make them interfere with gameplay as much as possible:
  for now, mostly only on ffa maps where it often has less serious games anyway
  attacking them is not possible, to avoid units accidently following them around the map
  critters are placed in ways where they will not get in the way
  they can be reclaimed instantly (should they block construction)
  they are killed easily (near explosions etc)
  but still they CAN decloak cloaked units..not sure how to fix that and how much it matters. if in doubt, reclaim them.
  they spawn on the maps defined in gaia_critters_config.lua
  modoptions "critters" = false to turn them off.
* Some bugfixes: missing sound on volume control and bug in commander change widget.
! The downloads of 9.728 got corrupted, which caused desyncs. So this release is mostly an attempt to fix this.
	
XTA v9.728
|dnw, jls and nor

* Fix landboat transition from land to water
* Improve commander selection widget (remembers selection from last game, better countdown text)
* Bugfixes for minelayer and buildspeed gadgets (probable cause for error: builder died)
* New sounds for D-Gun, Arm Penetrator and Core Doomsday machine. Sounds by Noruas. Should be less disturbing.
* Update cursor out of range gadget. It now gets range from engine. Cursor will still show bad attack cursor if 
  attack is blocked, but attack order is only dropped if it is outside of range (only for turrets).
* New splash sound for lava maps.
* Builders can now again fight.
* Fix hitsoundwet sound for Arm Bulldog
* Optimise MinimapX gadget to use less fps
* Force some gadgets that wouldn't unload to really do so (gadgets that have synced and unsynced parts).

	
XTA v9.727
|dnw, jls 

* Widget to set commander as member of group number 1 on gamestart (default disabled).
* Add avoidGround=0; and avoidNeutral=0; to disintegrator weapons.
* Update mission stuff
* Add debug mode (allows gadget profiler to run, use it to troubleshoot which gadget is the problem)
* Remove stop and wait commands from units that cannot do that,
  remove fight from units that cannot attack (like mine layers, construction
  units, air scouts, spies), remove attack from anti-nukes (they still do their
  thing), remove move, attack and patrol from air repair pad. Add a self-destruct
  button to all units (can be hidden with hidecommands.lua widget, that widget
  added to xta but isn't enabled by default).
* Nerf ambusher and toaster range from 1330 to 1250 as it was in kloot's patches. Increase flak-weapon's
  projectile speed and areaofeffect (they differ, but for example arm flakker has
  speed 1950 -> 2450 and aoe 150 -> 176), and decrease their damage vs ground
  units by about 30%. Decreased flakker projectile's amount of particles from 20
  to 10 and their separation from 0.35 to 0.15.
* Changed dragon's teeth's collision volume scales: arm: 28 34 28 -> 26 34 26,
  core: 26 36 26 -> 26 36 26, so that they let more shots pass.
* Fix for anti-nuke interception fail
* Set cannon velocity default to 0.25 instead of 0.5
* Add reclaim method as mod option: continuous = instant reclaim, discreet = lump sum reclaim after completion
* Fix hammer and jeffy
* Add snd_volume_osd widget. Decrease/Increase sound with and +. Engine changed the shortcut for speed change to alt +/-
* Prevent crashing aircraft from continuing to fire on enemies.	
	
	
XTA v9.726 (94.0 and next version)
|dnw, klt, jls, NTG and Scifi

New features or technical changes:
* Minelayers have a limited stock of mines (arm: 5, core: 6, naval: 8). Restocking costs same as building new minelayer (this is due to the fact that it's not as easy to build sensitive equipment such as mines in the field as inside factory conditions).
* Changed the collision volume of dragon's teeth so that scouts can fire through. Will still require micro. Increased dt hit points back to previous value, because otherwise they get destroyed too quickly due to changes in engine i n v. 93 ->
* Decreased duck odds from 1:100 to 1:1000
* Changed some effects in water explosions, they are now different depending on water depth and explosion impact altitude
* removed beeps from people placing their commander at start window (everybody hates it)
* Units do not target crashing aircraft (no change from latest patch)

XTA v9.726 beta (89.0 and next version)
|dnw and jls

* Decoy commanders now have same cloak radius as their respective normal commanders. Their weapons ranges now show as that of normal commanders to enemies, but show still are actual ones to allies.Decoys can be upgrades to level 2 decoys, which can disguise as opposite faction commanders. Level 2 decoys appear to enemies as level 2 commanders (D-Gun still reveals though).
* Added original commander ends option
* Renamed modoptions: renamed "teamdeathmode" to "mode" and "comm" to "commander" to make it easier to use autohost  commands. mode options are: "killall" (kill all units and remove dead players), "comends" (team commander ends), "commander" (original commander ends), "team" (kill all units and retain dead players) and "none" (game never ends). Spads command "!bset mode killall" replaces old "!bset teamdeathmode allyzerounits" which was a bit complicated.

XTA v9.725 (89.0 and next version)
|dnw, jls and klt

* Added support for changing Commanders in-game. New modoption: let users choose in game. Renamed Commander options to Automatic and Manual Commanders.
* Rewrote commander selection widget from scratch. Now it interacts with initial queue and advanced playerslist, and also has some more functionality than the normal interface during pre-game phase (such as a gong-gong sound when game starts). Commanders are set to hold position on startup rather than maneuver.
* Added "Team death on zero commanders", game mode that got removed with Spring 84 engine change
* Adjusted the default on/off for many widgets
* Updated several gadgets and widgets to newer versions
* Fixed the following widgets to work with current version of spring (version 85 and above): dontshoot (puts commander on hold fire during cloak), forcecloak(gives a wait order to the commander if user wants to cloak while the commander is in the process of building something)

* Added Plain Commander, without any upgrades
* Added mod option do enable or disable aircraft vs aircraft collision, default no collision
* All defense towers' aimspot now back in center, Spring 89.0 no longer supports modelCenterOffset tag, and it's an annoyance to adjust those via LUA, result, towers are less protected by dragon teeth walls

XTA v9.601 v9.6.3 (0.80 and next version)
|var

Various test versions and some quick sloppy fixes for Spring 0.82 support

XTA v9.6 (0.77b43 and next version)
|nn

* Flash and Peewee weapon accuracy increased.
* Added some lua, fixed some lua...
* Added two new units that walk upon the land.
* Nerfed Hitpoints of Instigator back to 810 from 844.
* Added two new bombers that tech 1.5 for the seaplane platform. These Bombers are slower but can take more damage and deal damage for its cost, best used on the frontline, these bombers are not good for passing defense.
* Fixed some Line of Sight issues 


XTA v9.585 (0.77b43 and next version)
|nor

* Evil Krogoth Lag Bug fixed, it also lagged the CPU elsewhere before being finished built.
* Arm and Core Torpedo Launchers in tech 1 are now Long Range Depth Chargers, they also have names now, Arm is Fisherman, while Core is Shrimper. 
* Boat DepthChargers have 6 times the turnrate for accuracy improvements.
* Increased range of Raven from 1200 to 1400, making it the only arty to outrange the popup cannons, but, it's very inaccurate at that range.
* Added 50 Percent HP to Vehicle Mine Layers
* Doubled Hp of Amphibious vehicle builders.
* Spider laser has 20 particles vs 200 particles per beam, because I hear that Pentium 3s cry at night.
* Hitsphers of mobile units are more accurate to the shape of the unit.
* Jethros no longer hit each other when lined up firing from its broadside in close packs.
* Spider has the ability to EMP overload itself, causing itself 33.4 percent damage and temporary paralyzing itself for 10-50 seconds. The small area surrounding the Spider takes mediocre damage and heavy paralyze damage of 5000, two Spiders can disarm a Bulldog or a Reaper. Takes one second to overload, and during that second, it will not fire.
* Hovercraft transports now cost an additional 300 metal and 2000 E, with 1000 hp added to its health, much more inefficient and cost something awful to lose in midgame, or use as a stealer.
* Reduced damage rate of peewee from 60 to 50 per second.
* Increased hitpoints of A.K. and Instigator, the Peewee and Flash counter. Reduced metal of A.K. by 1 metal point. A.K. and Instigator will lose in close combat vs its counter part, and has less speed, but it has higher range which makes it able to have an initiative blow or the ability to kite for short time.
* Tech 2 aircraft plants now have take 18 energy a second and has tech 2 radar range, just as tech 1 air labs do with tech 1 radars.
* Farks and Necros now self-repair at 2 hitpoints per second, still remain fragile.
* Tech 1 bombers behave better, bomb more likely. Downside, they fly through each other.
* Reduced scout missile from 730 to 630 range, but has better flight time to follow air units outside its range. Added new sound and trail effect for its small missile, as well as some arc fire.
